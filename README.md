# scientific-python-tutorials

This repository contains files which are beginner level tutorials for scientific Python.

# How to Get Started

Go to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com), which will let you write Python code without installing anything. Your code files will be stored in Google Drive and you can collaborate on them like you would with Google Docs. 

When you first open Google Colab, you will be in a notebook called "Welcome to Colab". To start a new notebook, click `file -> Open notebook -> GitHub`. In the bar which says "Enter a GitHub url or search by organization or user", paste the link for this repository: [https://github.com/rcxwhiz/scientific-python-tutorials](). That will let you choose any of the notebooks in this repository to edit and run.
